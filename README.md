I developed a deep learning model for the
classification of arrhythmias using 2-D ECG spectral
images. The goal was to accurately identify different
types of arrhythmias from ECG data by leveraging
the power of deep learning and image analysis
techniques. I preprocessed the raw ECG data to
generate 2-D spectral images, which were then used
as input to the deep learning model. Finally it
predicts the accuracy of the inserted image.
